// Project: Simple Tic-Tac-Toe
// About
// Everybody remembers this paper-and-pencil game from childhood: Tic-Tac-Toe, also known as Noughts and crosses or Xs and Os. A single mistake usually costs you the game, but thankfully it is simple enough that most players discover the best strategy quickly. Let’s program Tic-Tac-Toe and get playing!

// primer desafio:
// You have a guest list of the people who registered their stay at the hotel. There are 4 rooms in the hotel: 1 single room, 2 double rooms and 1 family room for three guests. The guest list consists of 4 lines. Each line contains the name or the names of the guests registered together in one room.

// Read the names of the registered guests from the list and output each name in a separate line and in reverse order starting with the last registered guest. Note that the order of the guests registered in each room is undefined.

// Description
// Tic-tac-toe is known all over the world. Each country may have its own version of the name, sometimes the rules are different, but the essence of the game remains the same. Below are the main rules that may be familiar to you since childhood.

// Tic-tac-toe is a game played by two players on a 3x3 grid. One of the players is 'X', and the other player is 'O'. X plays first, then O takes the next turn, and so on.

// The players write 'X' and 'O' on a 3x3 field.

// The first player that puts 3 X's or 3 O's in a straight line (including diagonals) wins the game.

// Objectives
// Your first task in this project is to print the game grid in the console output. Use what you’ve learned about the print() function to print three lines, each containing three characters (X’s and O’s) to represent a game of tic-tac-toe where all fields of the grid have been filled in.

// Example
// The example below shows how your output might look:

// X O X
// O X O
// X X O
